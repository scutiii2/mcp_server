"""Refuses request bodies larger than a cap before they are read.

FastAPI reads and parses a whole body before any dependency runs, so a
size check in a route would come after the memory is spent. This pure-ASGI
middleware answers 413 on a too-large Content-Length up front, and stops a
body without one (chunked) as soon as it passes the cap.
